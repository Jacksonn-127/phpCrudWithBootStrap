Simple PHP Student Management App
This is a basic PHP application designed to manage student information stored in a MariaDB database. It provides a simple web interface to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a students table. Users can:
.
Create: Add new student records (e.g., name, age).
Read: View a list of all students and their details.
Update: Modify existing student information.
Delete: Remove student records from the database
.
The application demonstrates fundamental database interaction using PHP's PDO (PHP Data Objects) for secure and efficient communication with the MariaDB database. It's a straightforward example for learning basic database-driven web development in PHP.
